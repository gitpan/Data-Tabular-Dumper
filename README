Data::Tabular::Dumper aims to make it easy to turn tabular data into as many
file formats as possible.  This is useful when you need to provide data that
folks will then process further.  Because you don't really know what format
they want to use, you can provide as many as possible, and let them choose
which they want.

Tabular data means data that has 2 dimensions, like a list of lists,
a hash of lists, a list of hashes or a hash of hashes.
